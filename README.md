## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end.
The front end is the voice interface, or VUI.
The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model.
The back end is where the logic of your skill resides.

## Skill Setup

 * If this is your first skill, choose the [Alexa-Hosted backend instructions](./instructions/setup-vui-alexa-hosted.md) to get started quickly.
